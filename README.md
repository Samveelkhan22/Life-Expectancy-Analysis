# Life Expectancy Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing life expectancy data from a CSV file. The script reads the data, finds the overall maximum and minimum life expectancy, analyzes life expectancy for a specific year, and identifies the largest drop in life expectancy between years.

## Features

- **Overall Analysis**: Identifies the maximum and minimum life expectancy across all countries and years in the dataset.
- **Year-Specific Analysis**: Calculates the average life expectancy for a user-specified year and identifies the countries with the highest and lowest life expectancies for that year.
- **Trend Analysis**: Finds the largest drop in life expectancy for any country between consecutive years.
